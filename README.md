# E-Commerce Program
## Description
This project aims to develop a simple e-commerce management system implemented in Java, utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The program is designed to record every transaction made by buyers in the e-commerce environment, featuring three main menus: Add Order, View Order, and Cancel Order. Users can efficiently manage their transactions through console output without the need for a graphical interface.

By leveraging OOP concepts, this program emphasizes code reusability and maintainability, providing a straightforward solution for order management. This project serves as a valuable tool for developers and businesses looking to streamline their e-commerce operations and gain insights into transaction handling via a console-based approach.
